            Proud, Unusida Students Win Silver Medals in International Events
          </h3>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            Sidoarjo, NU Online East Java At the beginning of 2024, students
            from Nahdlatul Ulama University Sidoarjo (Unusida) achieved another
            achievement in the international arena. This time, students from the
            Faculty of Computer Science (Filkom) and the Faculty of Teacher
            Training and Education (FKIP) won Silver Medals in the 2024
            International Young Moslem Inventor Award (IYMIA) event organized by
            the Indonesian Young Scientist Association (IYSA) at the Bogor
            Agricultural Institute (IPB), Thursday-Sunday (11-14/01/2024).

          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            The competition was attended by hundreds of participants from
            various countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Africa, Saudi
            Arabia, etc. The Unusida student team consisted of Bonang Ramadhani
            Hidayatullah (Informatics Engineering), Muhammad Af Rizal Mumtaz
            (Information Systems), Yunia Nuri Hidayah (PGSD), Ahmad Yauman Syifa
            (DKV), and Aisyah Adawiyah (PBI).

          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            Supervisor, Arda Surya Edtya, revealed that all this time he had
            been targeting international competitions that were in line with
            Unusida as an Islamic campus. Therefore, he directed students to be
            able to present an innovative Al-Qur'an learning media system that
            makes deep use of learning and audio integration. This Mumtaz
            application can be an educational medium for teaching and helping
            anyone to memorize and study the Al-Quran.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            “We thought of creating a system that can help anyone who wants to
            memorize the Al-Quran. "This system then becomes a provision for
            participating in international events," he said to NU Online East
            Java, Wednesday (17/01/2024). The Head of the Informatics
            Engineering Study Program (Kaprodi) really appreciates the potential
            of students in applying the material they have studied.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            “During the last 2 months, I have tried to direct students to create
            a system to compete in international events. "Thank God, students
            can understand and execute it well," he said. The team leader,
            Bonang Ramadhani Hidayatullah, explained that he and his team
            created an application called Mumtaz. This application is similar to
            the online Al-Qur'an application, but uses a deep learning model
            which can help anyone learn and memorize the Al-Qur'an.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            Through the audio scan feature, it is hoped that a more accurate
            assessment can be made in assessing recitation fluency so that it
            can help evaluate Al-Quran alerts read by users. “This application
            uses deep learning methods to assess recitation and punctuation
            fluency. "So it can help those who want to study or memorize the Al
            Qur'an," he explained.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            The Mumtaz application aims to optimize the use of mobile
            applications to help anyone memorize the Koran with the easiest and
            most enjoyable method. Which can provide benefits such as making
            reading easier, fluency in reading recitation, improving reading,
            and helping rote memory. The Mumtaz application system is equipped
            with many menus to help users learn more about the Koran. In
            general, this application has 5 menus such as digital Al-Quran,
            recitation e-book, prayer times, evaluation of Al-Quran chanting,
            and tips for memorizing the Al-Quran.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            Through a trial survey that had been carried out, he said that of
            the 30 respondents, 72 percent answered that it was very helpful and
            entertaining, 16 percent answered that the Mumtaz application was
            quite helpful and entertaining, and 12 percent answered that the
            Mumtaz application functioned normally. Speed in assessing the level
            of accuracy of the recitation and the location of errors when
            reading are the advantages of this application. So that when people
            learn to read and memorize the Al-Quran, they can pay more attention
            to makhorijul letters, recitation and fluency.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            "Indeed, it is currently still in the development stage, so the
            content is still only a short letter. "It needs to be developed
            further before it is used by many people," he said. Bonang revealed
            that this was the first time he and his team had created a project
            using audio deep learning. However, there are Informatics
            Engineering and Information Systems courses which are a reference
            for completing the designed Mumtaz application.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            "We experienced difficulties because the deep learning method was
            much more difficult because it used coding with a quite complicated
            algorithm system. "Thank God, the team consisting of cross-study
            programs can complement each other so that the Mumtaz application
            can be completed," he said.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text col-sm-7">
            Meanwhile, team member Muhammad Af Rizal Mumtaz felt very proud
            because he was able to get a medal. Initially he didn't have time to
            think about winning, he just tried to maximize everything to gain
            experience. "Our motivation is not to disappoint our supervisors, so
            we always try to focus and always maximize every stage, from
            preparation to presentation in front of the jury," he concluded.
